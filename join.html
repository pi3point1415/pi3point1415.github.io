        <h2>The Classical Way</h2>
        <p>Visit us for <a href="rush.html">rush</a>!</p>
        <p>
            ET holds rush twice a year: Fall rush is a week of fun at the beginning of
            September, and spring rush is a more laid-back smattering of events over
            IAP and early February. For either, we’re bound to have events that catch
            your interest, so hop on our van and come over! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The idea is to get to know us while having some fun and making friends
            with other potential members. Throughout the week, as we get to know you
            and whether you might be interested in living at ET, we’ll give out “bids,”
            or invitations to join the house.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What does a bid mean? First of all, it means we think you’re awesome, and we
            want you around more! Second, it means we hope you’ll consider pledging. The
            week after rush is “bid decision period,” when you’re encouraged to hang out
            at ET as much as you want and get to know us better. At any time during that
            week, you can declare that you’re pledging, which means you become a member
            of the house for a semester. You can be a part of the house as much or as
            little as you’d like during that semester, and at the end of it you choose
            whether to continue being a member. Even if you choose not to pledge (or not
            to continue after your pledge semester), you’ll be welcome to visit us for
            dinner or events any time!
        </p>

        <h2>The Postmodernist Way</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to finalize your housing plans before the next ET rush, or just
            can't make it to rush events, shoot us an e-mail at et-www@mit.edu letting us
            know you’re interested, or
            <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtz1hWfg9-ttbe0ixGLPtJQxhMmCpglXn3Mfz8BFnUF2XFWg/viewform?usp=sf_link">
            fill out this form</a>. We’ll set up a time for you to visit the house
            (in-person or over Zoom), get to know us a bit, and ask any questions you have.
            In the following couple days, we’ll have a brief discussion as a house to make
            sure everyone’s on board, and get back to you with a bid.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bad Way</h2>
        <p>The only bad way is not reaching out to us, and missing out on an awesome place that could have become your home. :(
        </p>

        <h2>Summer Housing</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re looking for a more temporary home, we’re happy to accommodate!
            Email et-summer-housing@mit.edu, and we’ll give you further details.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We can accommodate weird schedules (e.g. here for 3 weeks in June and 2 weeks
            in August) and will only charge you for the time you’re here. Summer housing
            encompasses the time between the Memorial Day and two weeks before the start
            of the semester (in Summer 2023, May 29 through August 19). Unlike during the
            semester, we’re happy to house any students, even if they don't go to MIT.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As of 2023, Summer housing costs $245/week (with a discount to $230/week for the
            full summer), which includes laundry, internet, use of the kitchen, and other basics. 
            We keep one common room air conditioned, and charge $25/week for using air conditioners in personal rooms. 
            (If you are reading this in the future, prices may have increased due to inflation.)
