        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h3>Is ET a fraternity?</h3>
        <p>
            No, we’re not a fraternity! We’re one of MIT’s Independent Living Groups, and our
            only resemblance to a fraternity is that we’re a group of students living together.
            Unlike fraternities, we accept people of all genders and ages. We never haze members.
            We are alcohol-free and drug-free. Our parties are also largely
            focused on puzzles and board games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather, ET is a group of about 20 students who live together like a family. We eat
            dinners together, study together, play games together, and take care of each other.
            We’re known for liking beanbags, board games, puzzles, and rubber ducks.
        </p>

        <h3>How much does it cost to live at ET?</h3>
        <p>
            Semesterly rent is around $4500, subject to variance from inflation. All food,
            utilities, laundry, etc. is included in this cost. Compare to MIT housing rates
            <a target="_blank" href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/housing/undergraduate-housing/residence-halls/undergraduate-housing-rates">here</a>.
            First year students are not charged rent because they already have to pay rent to MIT.
        </p>

        <h3>How far is ET from campus?</h3>
        <p>
            ET is about 2 miles from campus. This might sound far, but we have a van
            which goes to and from campus several times per day, and MIT operates the
            saferide shuttle after 6:00pm which stops right at our doorstep. If all
            else fails, it's a pleasant 15 minute bike ride or 40 minute walk along the
            Charles River.
        </p>

        <h3>What sizes of rooms are offered?</h3>
        <p>
            We have every size of room from single to quad, and we make sure to
            optimize room assignments for everybody's preferences. All rooms cost
            the same.
        </p>

        <h3>Does ET have a mealplan?</h3>
        <p>
            We have communal dinners 5 nights per week and we stock plenty of extra
            food and leftovers for all other meals. All food is included with rent,
            so most people find that they never need to purchase their own food.
        </p>

        <h3>What house duties are there?</h3>
        <p>
            Everybody who joins is expected to contribute a certain amount of work
            to keeping the house clean and functioning, but you get to choose which
            house duties you want to do and avoid the ones you hate. Examples of chores
            include cooking dinner, making instacart orders, cleaning, and washing dishes.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I join with a cat?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, for allergy reasons, we are unable to accept any cats.</p>
