        <h1>Virtual Tour</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to our home! We'd love for you to drop by in person,
            but in the meantime, we hope this site will give you a glimpse
            into what things are like at ET.
        </p>
        
        <p>

        <h2>Front Rooms</h2>
        <img src="images/tour/Front Rooms.jpg" alt="Front Rooms">
        <p>
            Immediately after walking in, on your right, you will see front rooms,
            the most social room in the house. Here you can will find plenty
            of beanbags and couches to lounge on and plenty of whiteboards
            full of everything from alignment charts to group theory to square
            dancing diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since front rooms is our primary social space, you will likely see
            people playing board games, working on their assignments, playing
            Beat Saber, or having nerdy conversations. Front rooms has plenty of
            outlets, chargers, and plenty of people ready to help you on that
            tough PSET problem which makes it a great place to study as long as
            you don't mind a bit of chatter.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter Room</h2>
        <!--<img src="images/tour/Chapter Room.jpg" alt="Chapter Room">-->
        <p>
            If you prefer a quieter place to work, then consider chapter room,
            right across the hall. Chapter room also has plenty of beanbags and
            couches, but it's generally less social than front rooms and it has
            closing doors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chapter room is also air conditioned during the summer which makes it
            a very nice place to hang out if you like it cooler. On the other hand,
            when it's not too hot, we sometimes use the fireplace to make s'mores.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, chapter room has an impressive library of books, including
            several textbooks that are required for various MIT classes. If you
            enjoy music, there are also two pianos (a grand piano and an electric
            keyboard with headphones for quieter playing) and several smaller
            musical instruments.
        </p>

        <h2>Dining Room</h2>
        <img src="images/tour/Dining Room.jpg" alt="Dining Room">
        <p>
            Five nights per week, we have communal dinners starting at about 6pm.
            Everyone gathers to enjoy the delicious foods prepared by that day's
            chefs. This is also one of our most social times, and our lighthearted
            dinner are often accompanied by lots of laughing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dining room also houses fourth table, a table dedicated to dozens
            of different types of snacks from fresh fruit to leftover desserts to
            goldfish.
        </p>

        <h2>Kitchen</h2>
        <img src="images/tour/Kitchen.jpg" alt="The Kitchen">
        <p>
            ET is fully equipped with a well-stocked industrial kitchen. Our 6-burner
            gas stove, two ovens, and organized spice rack make it a pleasure to
            cook in. The kitchen features a full size fridge and freezer for personal
            food, a massive two-door fridge for leftovers and other food that's open
            to anyone, a full freezer of open food, and an additional fridge and freezer
            for the weekly chefs. In addition to food for official dinners, we always
            keep plenty of extra food and cooking supplies for anyone to eat between
            meals or to prepare your own meals on days without an official dinner.
        </p>

        <h2>Pit</h2>
        <img src="images/tour/Pit.jpg" alt="The Pit">
        <p>
            Heading downstairs, you'll find the pit, our third large social room. Like
            our other social rooms, you'll find a large couch a beanbags, perfect for
            watching movies or playing video games on our projector. This room also
            features our massive board game collection (181 unique games and counting!)
        </p>
        <p>
            This room also serves as the gateway to several small rooms including the
            laundry room (unlike dorms, laundry is free at ET!) and work room, which has
            just about every tool you could ever need.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Rooms</h2>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Icebox, an example of a two-person room</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            There are a few personal rooms in the basement, but you'll find most of them
            on the second floor. Every member of the hosue gets a personal room, including
            pleges who are still officially living on campus, with a desk, dresser, and
            wardrobe. We have 2 singles, 3 doubles, 2 triples, and 3 quads, although rooms
            are rarely used to their full capacity, and we make sure to optimize for
            everyone's rooming preferences. Unlike dorms, your housebill is fixed
            regardless of room size, so you won't have to choose between an affordable
            room and one you're comfortable in.
        </p>

        <h2>Dorm</h2>
        <p>
            You might have noticed that our personal rooms don't have beds in them! That's
            because all of our beds are in one big room called dorm. This seems pretty
            strange to a lot of people at first, but most actives actually find that it's
            very nice. Dorm is always kept dark and
            quiet, regardless of the time of day, so you can sleep whenever you want,
            helping to accommodate all sorts of sleep schedules, and your roomates won't
            keep you up with their late night studying when you need to get some sleep
            before your exams tomorrow morning. We encourage people who join to try
            sleeping in dorm for at least a night or two, and if it doesn't work out,
            then you can move a mattress into your personal room, as long as your
            roommates are okay with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the way dorm is setup, we have one extra personal room called
            Trap that isn't assigned to anybody but that anybody can use when they
            need extra privacy or are feeling sick and need to quarantine.
